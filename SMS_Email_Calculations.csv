Example Calculation - SMS:
SMS List: 2000 subscribers
Average Ticket: $40
Campaigns per month: 4

Per Campaign Calculation:
Opens: 2000 × 98% = 1960
Clicks: 1960 × 19.5% = 382
Revenue: 382 × $40 × 10 = $152,800
Monthly Revenue: $152,800 × 4 = $611,200

Example Calculation - Email:  
Email List: 5000 subscribers
Average Ticket: $40
Campaigns per month: 8

Per Campaign Calculation:
Opens: 5000 × 28.4% = 1420
Clicks: 1420 × 4.2% = 59.64
Conversions: 59.64 × 2.8% = 1.67
Revenue: 1.67 × $40 = $66.80
Monthly Revenue: $66.80 × 8 = $534.40
