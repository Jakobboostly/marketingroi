Cumulative Factor Calculation:
Daily Revenue = Base Revenue × Day Multiplier × Holiday Multiplier × Monthly Multiplier × Weather Multiplier × Event Multiplier

Example Calculations:

Normal Tuesday in January:
Base Revenue: $1000
Day Multiplier: 0.7 (Tuesday)
Monthly Multiplier: 0.88 (January)
Adjusted Revenue: $1000 × 0.7 × 0.88 = $616

Friday in December with Light Snow:
Base Revenue: $1000  
Day Multiplier: 1.4 (Friday)
Monthly Multiplier: 1.15 (December)
Weather Multiplier: 0.90 (Light Snow)
Adjusted Revenue: $1000 × 1.4 × 1.15 × 0.90 = $1449

Mother's Day Sunday in May:
Base Revenue: $1000
Day Multiplier: 1.2 (Sunday) 
Holiday Multiplier: 1.51 (Mother's Day)
Monthly Multiplier: 1.08 (May)
Adjusted Revenue: $1000 × 1.2 × 1.51 × 1.08 = $1958
