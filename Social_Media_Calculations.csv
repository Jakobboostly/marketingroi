Example Calculation - Instagram:
Followers: 5000
Total Likes: 15000 (on last 10 posts)
Posts: 100
Average Ticket: $45

Engagement Rate: (15000 ÷ 10) ÷ 5000 = 1500 ÷ 5000 = 30% (High engagement!)
Current Revenue: 5000 × 0.005 × $45 = $1125
Potential Revenue: 5000 × 0.018 × $45 = $4050 (Using high performance rate)
Opportunity: $4050 - $1125 = $2925

Example Calculation - Facebook:
Followers: 3000
Running Ads: Yes
Active Page: Yes
Average Ticket: $45

Base Rate: 0.8%
Ads Multiplier: 2.5
Activity Multiplier: 1.0
Effective Rate: 0.008 × 2.5 × 1.0 = 2%
Current Revenue: 3000 × 0.002 × $45 = $270
Potential Revenue: 3000 × 0.02 × $45 = $2700
Opportunity: $2700 - $270 = $2430
